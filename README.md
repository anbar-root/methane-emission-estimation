# methane-emission-estimation

**Type:** Master's Thesis Project  
**Author:** Andrii Baranichenko  
**Technologies:** Python, AWS (EC2, S3), Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Xarray

## 🛰️ Project Overview
This project focuses on building an **inverse model** for estimating methane emissions from satellite observations.  
The workflow involves **data retrieval, preprocessing, filtering, normalization, and visualization** of atmospheric methane concentration fields.

The study was conducted as part of a master's thesis at the National Technical University of Ukraine *"Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute"*.

## ⚙️ Features
- Processing of **Sentinel-5P satellite data** (methane concentration).  
- Application of data filtering and normalization techniques.  
- Implementation of an **inverse modeling approach** for emission estimation.  
- Visualization of methane distribution and model outputs.  
- Deployment of computations on **AWS EC2** and storage on **AWS S3**.
